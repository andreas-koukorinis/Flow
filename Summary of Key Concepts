Summary of Key Concepts I've Studied:
EFRoM (ETF Flow Risk-o-Meter) is a sophisticated risk appetite measurement tool developed by Deutsche Bank that:

Core Methodology:

Combines TAARSS (Tactical Asset Allocation Relative Strength Signal) indicators across 14 asset classes
Each asset class has a risk factor ranging from -1.5 to +1.5
Risk-off assets (US Treasuries, Gold) have negative factors
Risk-on assets (EM, Small Caps) have positive factors
Formula: EFRoM Level = Σ[TAARSS[i] × Risk Factor[i]]


TAARSS Foundation:

Measures ETF flow strength using two regression components:

Magnitude: Slope of regression through origin (β₁)
Consistency: R² of line of best fit
TAARSS = β₁ × R²


Analyzes normalized cumulative net cash flows as % of AUM


Interpretation:

Level: Positive = risk-on mode, Negative = risk-off mode
Month-over-Month Change: Positive = add risk, Negative = reduce risk
The change has predictive power for next month's risky asset performance


Practical Applications:

Multi-asset portfolios (60/40 variations)
Smart Beta strategies (Momentum/Min Vol rotation)
Sector rotation (Utilities/Financials/Materials)
Both long-only and long/short implementations


Historical Performance (Dec 2014 - May 2016):

Binary strategy returned 21% vs flat ACWI performance
Enhanced Sharpe ratios across various portfolio implementations
Better drawdown protection during risk-off periods



I'm ready to answer any technical or mathematical questions about this framework!
